## 📘 Project Overview

**SpeakEasy** is a web-based AI English voice tutor designed to help users improve their English communication skills interactively and naturally. The app enables users to **speak into the microphone**, analyze their voice, correct grammar and fluency issues, and receive real-time feedback.

Many users struggle with fluency, confidence, grammar, and slang usage—especially in non-native English-speaking regions. SpeakEasy aims to solve this with a simple and intuitive interface powered by modern web technologies and Spring Boot for the backend.

The application can act as:
- 👩‍🏫 A personal language coach
- 🎯 A pronunciation trainer
- 🗣️ A grammar corrector
- 🎮 A gamified language-learning assistant

It’s perfect for **students, job seekers, and professionals** who want to speak more confidently and correctly in English.

## 💡 Inspiration Behind the Project

I built SpeakEasy because many people around me (including myself) faced hesitation while speaking English fluently. Tools like Duolingo help, but lack real **speaking feedback**.

So I created a solution that combines:
- 🧠 Real-time feedback
- 🎤 Voice interaction
- 🚀 Simple and fun learning methods

All using **HTML, CSS, JS (frontend)** and **Java Spring Boot (backend)** — no fancy frameworks, just clean coding.
